      <h3>Fancy seeing you here!</h3>
      <h4>I'm Alvin Liu:</h4>
<p>Passionate individual skilled at marketing, technical, presentation, and networking that
is constantly trying to not only utilize his skills and expertise, but to improve them so he can help
others!</p>

<p>
      𝐁𝐞𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐰𝐞 𝐛𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐧, 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞'𝐬 𝐚 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰 𝐨𝐟 𝐰𝐡𝐨 𝐈 𝐚𝐦: (Is it possible to capture a whole life in a paragraph?)<br>
I pride myself on being an outgoing, friendly, and resilient individual who strives to accomplish my passions and goals to become a manager at a Software Engineering Firm. I can create and demonstrate applications of effective presentation and communication skills- something that's steadily become a requisite in the computer science field. Whenever given the opportunity to demonstrate leadership opportunities, my mindset remains to note that leadership is a privilege; and I've come to prioritizing the inclusivity of the team to overcome challenges, together. <br>

𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗳 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁:<br>
I had difficulty speaking up due to the lack of confidence. Have you ever interrupted a serious conversation? What do you say? When I grew up, both of my parents spoke Mandarin, and only one spoke English. I hesitated, taking time to process before I spoke up or shared my piece. Today, I'm capable of delivering speeches to thousands of individuals, and it wasn't done overnight. It was done by taking steps into a new personal frontier, guided by those who support me.<br>
 
𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘂𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝘀𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗶𝗿𝗲𝘀 𝗺𝗲:<br>
Who are you? You can answer in a variety of ways; but fail in the next question: "What are we capable of?". This has to replace the "Survival of the fittest" mindset. While in high school, I realized that 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲𝐨𝐧𝐞 has a limit— we just don't stop. We push those limits and become more capable in every moment of our lives. The roof of growth has grown exponentially. Think about the very device in your hands right now. Your possibility of choice. Your next click— nearly 𝙞𝙣𝙛𝙞𝙣𝙞𝙩𝙚 possibilities. But just like that, the possibility of where you might go next is limited if you don't act. I've recognized that standing still means that I'm not increasing my capabilities. <br>

Along our path of evolution, AI has posed a challenge to push us to increase our capabilities. The only difference now is that we need to redefine what is possible, and advance forwards into the future with infinite possibilities. So let me join you in my journey to expand my capabilities!<br>

𝗠𝘆 𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗶𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲𝘀:<br>
Management, Computer Science, Leadership, Community Engagement, Data Analysis, Marketing, SEO, Inclusivity, Presenting, Programming, Effective Communications, UI testing, UX testing, Software Development, Algorithm functionality and STEM-related fields.<br>
